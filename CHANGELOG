= 3.2.0

* ActiveRecord 3.2 only.


= 3.1.0

* Works with ActiveRecord 3.1 or 3.2

* The group object is now an ActiveRecord::Relation so you can further scope it.

* New group scoped #blank? and #present? which simply checks if the proxy owner has a group set.
  This allows us to tune the SQL generated to IN statements only when needed, even if a grouped 
  scope is being used.

* New group.ids_sql which is an Arel SQL literal. Avoids large groups IDs and better query plans.
